# Crack Your Internship / Crack Your Placement Challenge

ðŸš€ **45-Day DSA Challenge by Arsh** ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with the **#CrackYourInternship** / **#CrackYourPlacement** challenge! This repository contains my daily progress as I solve 4-5 DSA problems each day, curated from the DSA Sheet by Arsh.

## Challenge Overview

- **Duration:** 45-60 Days
- **Daily Commitment:** 4-5 DSA problems
- **Total Problems:** ~270-280
- **Objective:** To get interview-ready for product-based companies by solving frequently asked DSA questions.

## Repository Structure

- Each day has its own folder (e.g., `Day1/`, `Day2/`, etc.).
- Each folder contains markdown files (`Problem1.md`, `Problem2.md`, etc.) for each problem solved that day.
- The markdown files include the problem statement, approach, solution, and any code snippets.
